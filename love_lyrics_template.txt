(Verse 1)

I met you on a starry night, so bright,
In the city of {place1}, love took flight.
Your smile, a beacon in the city's glow,
In the world of {place1}, you're all I'd ever know.

(Chorus)

With {partner_name}, my heart found its song,
In your arms, where I truly belong.
{pet_name} wagging its tail, oh so true,
Time with you, like morning's first dew.

(Verse 2)

We danced through {place2}, hand in hand,
A world of love, like a castle in the sand.
{day_activity}, our laughter filled the air,
With {partner_name}, every moment was rare.

(Chorus)

{partner_name}, you're my guiding star,
Together we've journeyed, no matter how far.
{flying_animal} in the sky, so high above,
Our love story, an epic, a tale of true love.

(Bridge)

Every moment, every touch,
{beautiful_place} where our love meant so much.
{night_activity} under the moon's gentle grace,
In your embrace, I've found my special place.

(Verse 3)

From {place1} to {place2}, our love has grown,
Through {day_activity} and {night_activity}, we've shone.
Hand in hand with {partner_name}, forever to be,
This love, our treasure, for all to see.

(Chorus)

{partner_name}, you're my heart's desire,
In your love, I'll never tire.
{swimming_animal} dances in the sea,
Our love's waves, wild and free.

(Outro)

As the sun sets, colors in the sky,
{last_vacation_spot}, where our love will never die.
A love story to cherish, so pure and true,
{partner_name}, forever, it's me and you.
