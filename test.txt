BEACH

(Verse 1)

I packed my bags, set off on a flight
To a place where dreams take flight
Golden beaches, the sun so bright
In the land of wda everything felt just right

(Chorus)

wda by my side, we explored the shore
Danced with the waves, feeling the pure
wda playing in the sand
Time slipping away like grains in my hand

(Verse 2)

Ventured through dwa, a magical sight
Mountains kissed the heavens, such a breathtaking height
dwa in the morning, under the clear blue sky
wda and I felt like we could fly

(Chorus)

wda by my side, we climbed so high
Lost in the moment, reaching for the sky
dwa cheering from the trees
Nature's symphony, bringing us to our knees

(Bridge)

Every moment, every sight
dwa's beauty, pure delight
dwa under the stars
Lost in time, no walls, no bars

(Verse 3)

From wda to dwa, the adventure goes on
Through dwa and dwa, we carry on
Hand in hand with wda, heart full of glee
This vacation, a dream, a moment of glee

(Chorus)

wda by my side, we sail the sea
The horizon ahead, full of mystery
dwa guiding our way
In this paradise, we're destined to stay

(Outro)

As the sun sets, painting the sky
dwa's memories, forever in my eye
A vacation to treasure, a love so true
wda and I, under the starry blue
