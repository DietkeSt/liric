(Verse 1)

Packed my bags, flew to the coast
Where the sea breeze hits you the most
Sandy shores, sun tans in sight
In {place1} town, it's always so bright

(Chorus)

With {partner_name}, we hit the beach
Salt in the air, within our reach
{pet_name} digs a hole in the ground
Time's slipping away, such joy we've found

(Verse 2)

Strolling through {place2}, what a view
Mountains and skies, all shades of blue
Surfing {day_activity} as the waves roll by
With {partner_name}, we touch the sky

(Chorus)

{partner_name}, right by my side
Climbing up high, feeling so wide
{flying_animal} sings from above
Nature's rhythm, pure peace and love

(Bridge)

Each moment, such a sight
{beautiful_place} shines so bright
{night_activity} under the moon
No schedule, just us, it's a sweet tune

(Verse 3)

From {place1} to {place2}, adventure we chase
{day_activity} and {night_activity}, at our own pace
With {partner_name}, joy's guaranteed
This vacation's the dream we all need

(Chorus)

{partner_name}, as we sail the sea
Horizons ahead, what will they be?
{swimming_animal} guides our way
In this paradise, we're here to stay

(Outro)

As the sun sets, colors paint the sky
{last_vacation_spot}, memories, oh so high
A vacation we'll treasure, love so true
{partner_name}, under the stars, just us two
